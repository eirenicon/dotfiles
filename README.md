# dotfiles
For those who might be thinking about using or building a tiling window manager setup... I have built my first bspwm desktop (number one of three). If you are interested in what and how to build one for yourself you may find the help guide of some use (be aware it is not short).

I have changed the format of my dotfiles.  All you need do, should you wish to use all of my provided files is rename the config and local folders to .config & .local.  After renaming both simply copy them into the corresponding folders in your /home/<user> directories.  Remember to also make all scripts 'executable'.

Should you wish to use a select set of these dotfiles, simply drag and drop the ones you want to use...

To identify the base upon which these dotfiles apply, examine the config folder to determine which apps have corresponding dotfiles.

As always... this work is provided under the following agreement:

Remember, like with all of my work, I am only able to provide the following assurance(s):

    1. It is almost certainly going to work until it breaks; although I have to admit it may never work and that would be sad.
    2. When/if it does break, you may keep all of the pieces.
    3. If you find my materials helpful, both you & I will be happy, at least for a little while.
    4. My advice/work is worth every penny you paid for it!
